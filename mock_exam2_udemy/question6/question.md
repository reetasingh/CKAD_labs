```
Create a new pod called nginx1401 in the default namespace with the image nginx. Add a livenessProbe to the container to restart it if the command ls /var/www/html/probe fails. This check should start after a delay of 10 seconds and run every 60 seconds.


You may delete and recreate the object. Ignore the warnings from the probe.
```
